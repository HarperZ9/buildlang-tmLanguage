# Best-effort demo — these checks were run by the author against the current
# tree and passed; treat behavior on other environments as best-effort.
#
# Runs the genuine validation surface this repository uses (the same checks as
# .github/workflows/ci.yml). This package has no compiler/CLI of its own; the
# only runnable surface is JSON validation + whitespace check. Requires Python 3
# and git on PATH. Run from the repository root:
#
#   bash examples/validate_demo.sh
#
# The grammar maps the demo source examples/demo.quanta to TextMate scopes; to
# SEE highlighting you must open that file in an editor with the grammar
# installed (see USAGE.md). This script only validates the package files.
